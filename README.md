# üß† Facial Segmentation Overlay Microservice

This project is a backend microservice designed to process images of human faces and generate **SVG overlays** that visually highlight key facial regions such as the forehead, eyes, nose, cheeks, and chin.

---

## üéØ Purpose

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to design a **clean, production-ready backend service** that handles image input, performs computational processing, and returns structured visual results.  
It focuses on **modularity, performance, and clarity** ‚Äî ensuring the codebase is scalable and easy to maintain.

## üß© What It Does

1. **Accepts facial images** encoded in Base64 format.  
2. **Receives facial landmarks** and a **segmentation map** describing different regions of the face.  
3. **Processes and aligns** this data, even if the face is rotated or tilted.  
4. **Generates smooth SVG overlays** that trace and label each facial region.  
5. **Returns the SVG as Base64**, along with contour data for each region.

If the input does not contain a recognizable face, the service responds gracefully with a clear error message.

## üß† Key Concepts

- **Facial segmentation:** Identifying and separating facial regions from an image.  
- **Landmark alignment:** Adjusting for face rotation and position using key facial points.  
- **SVG overlays:** Creating a vector-based visual representation that highlights specific areas.  
- **Modular architecture:** Separating API endpoints, business logic, and data handling for clarity and testability.  
- **Scalable design:** Built to support asynchronous processing, caching, and monitoring.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Typical Workflow

1. A client uploads a face image through the API.  
2. The service decodes the image and segmentation data.  
3. The face is analyzed, aligned, and processed.  
4. Segmentation contours are extracted and transformed into SVG paths.  
5. The final SVG is returned, showing transparent, dashed overlays on the detected facial regions.

## üåü Goals

- Deliver a **clean, maintainable backend system** that can easily integrate into larger image-processing pipelines.  
- Provide a **foundation for AI-driven facial analysis** tools, visualization dashboards, or cosmetic applications.  
- Demonstrate **strong backend engineering principles** through thoughtful code structure and documentation.

---

## üì¶ Deliverables

- A fully functional backend service with an accessible API.  
- Endpoints for image submission and (optional) async job status checking.  
- Clear documentation explaining usage and expected results.  
- Example data for testing, including images, landmarks, and segmentation maps.

## üßæ Summary

This project represents a balance between **engineering rigor** and **creative implementation**.  
It emphasizes clarity, modularity, and performance while solving a real-world computer vision challenge ‚Äî generating visually accurate SVG overlays for human facial features.
